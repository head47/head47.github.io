# head47.github.io

This is supposed to be my intro website, as per WAD HW #1.

Things I've done so far in this repo:
1. Flask website:
    * /: redirect to /profile
    * /profile: an page with a few words about me, an image and a CSS sheet
2. static website for GH Pages: in the `gh-pages` branch
    * for now basically same as above, but without Flask
